# PlasmicFlix Demo

This is a demo of building a video streaming service on top of Plasmic and Next.js. To read more about how this works, check out our tutorial [here]().

## Getting Started

1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local`.

2. Run the development server:

```bash
yarn dev
```

3. Open your browser to see the result.

4. You can view the Plasmic-built frontend [here](https://studio.plasmic.app/projects/eqrDNQBEf6ytvNJgLEmjN2). If you want to make edits, clone the Plasmic project and note the new
   project ID and token. These fields will need to be updated in `.env.local` to reflect your changes.
