# Contentful + Plasmic example

Here we demo how you can make data from Contentful available for drag-and-drop for your content editors in the Plasmic Studio visual editor.

Note that there is now a more up-to-date, built-in version of this in Plasmic, and its source lives in the `plasmicpkgs` directory.
But this project still serves as a simple example of how to make simple [data-fetching code components](https://docs.plasmic.app/learn/data-code-components).

This is a Next.js project bootstrapped with [`create-plasmic-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-plasmic-app).

To play with the live Plasmic project:

https://studio.plasmic.app/projects/8ibg42QGrW4vGT7WCuKLAF

It includes a couple of code components:

- ContenfulFetcher, which fetches Contenful data (type and schema hard-coded for this app) and repeats some elements
- ContenfulField, which renders a specific text or image field (you pick from a dropdown)

## Getting started with local development

1. Run the development server (make sure it's listening on port 3000):

```bash
yarn dev
```

2. Open the corresponding Plasmic project:

https://studio.plasmic.app/projects/8ibg42QGrW4vGT7WCuKLAF

3. Clone it from the menu by the title:

4. In your clone, configure it to use http://localhost:3000 as your app host.

You can now start making changes to the way the code components work, and trying out the changes in the editor.
