# Plasmic CMS i18n

Live demo: https://plasmic-cms-i18n.vercel.app/

This is an example Next.js project demonstrating the localization/internationalization capabilities of Plasmic CMS.
This project includes a locale selector UI and shows you how to dynamically set the locale.
See the relevant code here: [pages/index.tsx](pages/index.tsx).

The Plasmic project is here: https://studio.plasmic.app/projects/mbmbKuYXsrojz2DccvPWPT

There is also a CMS database backing this project, but it can't be shared publicly.
You'll need to connect your own Plasmic CMS database to change any data.
